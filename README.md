### Anderson Nunes

I currently study **Full Stack Web Development** at **Trybe**. I consider myself a lifelong learner with a strong passion for science and technology. I've done scientific research in places like Federal UFRN (Brazil) and UMBC (USA). Additionally, I've worked as an Engineering Intern at CLBI, a rocket launch base of the Brazilian Space Agency. My goal is to work with challenging and creative web projects. Hobbies include meditation, journaling, reading and Linux.
