### Anderson Nunes

I currently work as **Android Software Engineer** at **XP Inc.** I consider myself a lifelong learner with a strong passion for science and technology. I've done scientific research in places like UFRN (Brazil) and UMBC (USA). Additionally, I've worked as an Engineering Intern at CLBI, a rocket launch base of the Brazilian Space Agency. My goal is to work with challenging and creative software projects.
